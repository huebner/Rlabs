################### R code for residual analysis

# In the 1840s and 1850s a Scottish physicist, James D. Forbes, wanted to be able to estimate 
# altitude above sea level from measurement of the boiling point of the water. 
# He studied the relationship between boiling point and pressure. Forbesâ€™ theory suggested 
# that over the range of observed values the graph of boiling point versus the logarithm of 
# pressure yields a straight line. Since the logs of the presures do not vary much, all 
# values of log(press) are multiplied by 100. This avoids studying very small numbers, 
# without changing the major features of the analysis
